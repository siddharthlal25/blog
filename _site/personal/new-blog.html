<p>Hi all. This is a new blog post which is primarily meant to test how to go about writing new posts for this blog which I very
conveniently lifted off of some github repository. Regardless, this is an excellent light-weight theme, and to be honest I like
it so much it almost feels like I commissioned it. So I think the first thank you goes to the awesome creators of this beautiful 
theme, which I found out are a bunch (or possibly a lonewolf) web developer based out of Bangalore. So thank you!</p>

<p>Apart from the credits, this will also serve as a practise for formatting these posts using a code editor. For refernce, I am writing
this as a markdown file in VS Code and thus have no idea how this actually looks on the web. Iâ€™ll try out a couple of markdown
commands to just make sure I got the hang of it.</p>

<h1 id="headings">Headings</h1>
<p>Under this, I would like to have multiple subheadings.</p>
<h2 id="topic-1">Topic 1</h2>
<p>So this should ideally be a subparagraph under the above heading.</p>
<h2 id="topic-2">Topic 2</h2>
<p>Second subtopic.
Trying to insert a link as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pkjm">link</a>. Heck I gotta say VS Code is beautiful. Even with markdown, it knows just the right type of syntax highlighting to help me out without making it look like a rainbow (<em>cough</em> <em>cough</em> eclipse.. <em>cough</em>).</p>
<h2 id="topic-3">Topic 3</h2>
<p>This is the last subheading.</p>

<p>I think this should suffice for a blog post. For all those unfortunate enough to have read this whole thing up until this point, you have my sincerest condolences and a genuine feeling of appreciation from the bottom of my heart. Now please dont do that again. Ciao.</p>

<p>-p</p>
