## *Hey Sid! Let's get to the point directly, did your previous PR get merged?*

Yes! The PR which involved creation of new data structure for `ImageHDU`s got merged, the code is up and running now!

## *Great, tell us what's the next PR all about?

After creating the data structure `CCDData` and making it compatible with all methods in [#31](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/CCDReduction.jl/pull/31), I went back to my closed PR [#30](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/CCDReduction.jl/pull/30) to take the code and make it compatible with `CCDData`. [#30](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/CCDReduction.jl/pull/30) consists of code that enables a user to apply function on a collection of `ImageHDU`s and then save them in new `FITS` files. Now, the new PR [#33](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/CCDReduction.jl/pull/33) enables the same functionalities but with `CCDData`s. This PR is in it's last stages of review and will get merged soon!

## *Hmmm, that sounds interesting, have you prepared some examples to show the usage of the package?*

Not yet, but don't worry, I have started working on proper usage guidelines and examples, will put it up soon!

## *Okay, tell us about your future plans?*

Currently, my primary goal is to get PR [#33](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/CCDReduction.jl/pull/33) merged, after this I will put up some basic examples for complete reduction process. After all this gets done, I will bump the version of the package and keep working on stretch goals!

Stay tuned to know more!
