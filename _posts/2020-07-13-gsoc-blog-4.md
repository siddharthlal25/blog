## *Hey Sid, did you pass your first evaluations?*

The results of the first evaluation was declared on the 4th of July and yes, I successfully completed my first evaluation!

## *How was your experience till now?*

It seems as if I started working yesterday, but reality is one and a half months are complete. The experience of working on this project was awesome, all thanks to my mentors.

## *So, what are the updates of these two weeks?*

I have been a bit puzzled in designing the end-user interface of the package, I was working on the issue [#28](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/CCDReduction.jl/issues/28) during which Miles figured out that use of `ImageHDU` is not good, since it is not operable upon once the `FITS` file is closed. So, we won't be able to operate on some collected `ImageHDU`s via iteration, since their respective `FITS` files would have been closed after iteration.

## *Hmmm, that seems like a problem, so what next?*

We have thought of designing a new data structure `CCDData`, that would keep the header and image data of `ImageHDU` coupled and can be even accessed when the `FITS` files are closed. Once, this is done we will go for release (the major one, about which I talked in the last blog). Stay tuned to find out more!
