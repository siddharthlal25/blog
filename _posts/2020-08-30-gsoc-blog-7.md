## *Hey Sid! What's the progress? What did you do in last 2 weeks?*

The work was completed on time! I spent the last two weeks coding up the saving versions of `ccds`, `arrays` and `filenames`. With these, one can apply a function on the desired object (i.e. ccd or array or filename) and can also save it to FITS file. There are various options available for saving, like the prefix name of the saved file, suffix name of saved file and also the location at which to save, check out the repo for more info!

## *Awesome, Can you show some work samples?*

Sure, here it is!

This is a bias frame as captured:

</p>

When the frame undergoes overscan subtraction followed by trimming the overscan region, it turns out to be:

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siddharthlal25/blog/master/_images/bias/processed.png">
</p>

Several bias frames after overscan subtraction and trimming are stacked together and combined, this is the master bias frame used for subsequent processing of images. This is how it looks:

</p>

Next comes the processing of flat frames, this is a *dome flat r* frame as captured:

<p align = "center">
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siddharthlal25/blog/master/_images/dome_flat/r/sample.png">
</p>

When the frame undergoes bias subtraction (by *master_bias*) followed by overscan subtraction and trimming, it looks something like: 

<p align = "center">
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siddharthlal25/blog/master/_images/dome_flat/r/processed.png">
</p>

Several *dome_flat_r* frames are stacked together and combined by mean, this results in:

<p align = "center">
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siddharthlal25/blog/master/_images/dome_flat/r/master.png">
</p>

Similarly, below are processed and combined frames (i.e. master frame) of *dome_flat_i* and *dome_flat_z*:
