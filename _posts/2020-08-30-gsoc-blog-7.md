## *Hey Sid! What's the progress? What did you do in last 2 weeks?*

The work was completed on time! I spent the last two weeks coding up the saving versions of `ccds`, `arrays` and `filenames`. With these, one can apply a function on the desired object (i.e. ccd or array or filename) and can also save it to FITS file. There are various options available for saving, like the prefix name of the saved file, suffix name of saved file and also the location at which to save, check out the repo for more info!

## *Can you show some work samples?*

Sure, here it is:
