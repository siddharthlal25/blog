## *Hey Sid, you mentioned about releasing the package in the previous post, did you go for the release?*

Yes, I wrote the interface for `combine` function with FITS files and finally released *version-0.2.0*, come check it! ([CCDReduction.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/CCDReduction.jl))

## *So, how were the weeks 3 & 4?*

These two weeks were quite interesting! After packing all the basic functionalties in the package, *version-0.2.0* was released, the next problem to be tackled was collecting and listing all relevant files from a directory. So, to solve this `fitscollection` was created, it takes a path, searches it recursively (if the user wants) for FITS files with ImageHDUs, list them together and return them in a data frame. It has some advanced functionalities as well, check the [documentation](https://juliaastro.github.io/CCDReduction.jl/dev/api/#CCDReduction.fitscollection-Tuple{String}) to know more!

Next, we created generators for filenames, image arrays, and ImageHDUs which works something like this:
```
# listing all FITS files present at some location with ImageHDUs
df = fitscollection(“location_of_some_fits_files”)
for arr in arrays(df)
    # arr is the array representation of images present in entries of the data frame
    # (i.e. array of ImageHDU's image data)
end
```
The generators created were `filenames`, `arrays`, and `images`. `filenames` generates the path of the file, `arrays` generates the array representation of images in ImageHDU and `images` generates ImageHDU of FITS files. These generators work on output of `fitscollection` i.e. a data frame returned by the function. All these generators were written using [ResumableFunctions.jl](https://github.com/BenLauwens/ResumableFunctions.jl).

## *Hmmm, interesting! What's next?*

Currently, I am working on issue [#28](https://github.com/JuliaAstro/CCDReduction.jl/issues/28), once this gets done, there will be a big release! Stay tuned to know more!
